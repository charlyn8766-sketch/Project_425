# Naranjos â€” Weekly-Only Streamlit Scheduler (Keep Core Code)

This package preserves the original optimization code. Only the UI was changed to remove
daily line/bar charts and keep a single weekly line chart. All other outputs remain
(schedules, deviation summary, CSV downloads).

Run:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py
